# v3 of Schedule-X is coming!

v3 of Schedule-X is around the corner! You can expect a stable release at the end of August/beginning of September 2025. ðŸ¥³

A bunch of [new features](https://github.com/schedule-x/schedule-x/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Av3) are coming to the calendar. Most significantly,
Schedule-X is moving away from its own custom date/datetime format, and adopting [Temporal API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal).

  Not shipping next week? Consider hopping on v3 right away! It's not production-ready yet, but is planned to be so very soon.

## Reasoning

Many have correctly pointed out, that the current date/datetime format is not very intuitive for people that are used to working with standard formats like ISO 8601, or RFC 5545. Sticking to standards would also make it easier to integrate with other tools.

Additionally, the current date/datetime format only supports floating time, that is timestamps without awareness of timezones. With moving to Temporal API, implementing timezones will come almost out of the box.

Lastly, a nice bonus is that displaying dates according to non-gregorian calendars will be much easier, which is another feature some members of the community have been asking for.

## Can I already try it?

Yes!

You can try the new version of Schedule-X by installing any package with the beta tag, like:

```bash
npm install @schedule-x/calendar@beta @schedule-x/theme-default@beta
```

Or the premium plugins (with auth token like always):

```bash
npm install @sx-premium/interactive-event-modal@beta
```

There is a minimal but working example of how to use the new version here: https://github.com/schedule-x/v3-beta-example

The biggest change is basically this:

```ts
// v2 full day events
{
  start: "2025-08-16",
  end: "2025-08-17",
}

// v3 full day events

{
  start: Temporal.PlainDate.from("2025-08-16"),
  end: Temporal.PlainDate.from("2025-08-17"),
}

// v2 timed events

{
  start: "2025-08-16 10:00",
  end: "2025-08-16 11:00",
}

// v3 timed events

{
  start: Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2025-08-16T10:00:00+02:00[Europe/Berlin]'),
  end: Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2025-08-16T11:00:00+02:00[Europe/Berlin]'),
}
```

Additionally, you can now set a `timezone` in the calendar configuration, and install a timezone select: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@schedule-x/timezone-select

## What's next?

The current focus is to:

1) Find testers for the beta. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/schedule-x/schedule-x/issues) if you run into any problems while using the beta versions. This would help a lot!
2) ... nothing more for now ... We're almost there!

## Continued support for v2

There will be continued support for v2 for any bugs that are discovered. This general support will last for 6 months after the release of v3.

**However**, for premium users, this support will be extended to at least 1 year, and possibly longer if needed.

General EOL for v2 is then planned for 12 months after the release of v3, with said exception for premium users.
